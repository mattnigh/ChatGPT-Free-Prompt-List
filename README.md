## Project info

I use AI tools all the time and wished there was a great way to manage snippets for the (many) LLMs and Agents in my life. I made this tool (mostly) vibe-coding via Lovable for initial scaffolding, and Agent Mode in VS Code for functionality.

- Personal collections of your most effective prompts
