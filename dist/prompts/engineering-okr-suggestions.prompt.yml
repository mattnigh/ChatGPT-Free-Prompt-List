We're planning our Q3 engineering OKRs. Based on past initiatives (e.g., improving reliability, boosting developer experience, experimenting with AI), suggest 5 new OKR directions. I'd like a mix of technical bets, team health goals, and cross-org enablers, each written in a draft objective + key result format.
