"I have a dataset containing [describe data: e.g., customer feedback, product specifications, transaction records] that needs to be transformed into a structured format for analysis.

Current format:
[Describe or show example of current format]

Desired format:
[Describe or show example of desired format]

Specific challenges:
- [Challenge 1, e.g., inconsistent formatting]
- [Challenge 2, e.g., missing values]
- [Challenge 3, e.g., text that needs categorization]

How can I use AI to:
1. Clean and standardize this data
2. Extract the relevant information
3. Structure it according to my requirements
4. Identify and handle edge cases or anomalies

Please provide both conceptual approach and practical examples I could implement."
