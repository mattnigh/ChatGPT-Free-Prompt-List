Trace the evolution of prompt engineering from 2020 to 2025. I want to understand how best practices have changed with GPT-2 → GPT-4 → GPT-4 Turbo, how agents and retrieval-augmented generation have influenced prompt design, and which tools (e.g., LangChain, PromptLayer) shaped the ecosystem. Add timelines, milestones, and voices from the field.
