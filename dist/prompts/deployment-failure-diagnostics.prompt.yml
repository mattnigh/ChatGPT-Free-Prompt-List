Act as a DevOps engineer reviewing deployment logs for a failed rollout. Pinpoint where the failure occurred, what component it was in, and whether it's config, code, or infra-related. Also flag any misleading or missing log entries. Use this input: [PASTE HERE: deploy script output or CI/CD pipeline logs].
