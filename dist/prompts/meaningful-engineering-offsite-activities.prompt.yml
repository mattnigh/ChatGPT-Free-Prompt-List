We're planning a team offsite for 30 hybrid engineers and product folks. Suggest creative but low-lift activities (onsite or virtual) that help build trust, encourage meaningful cross-functional conversations, and don't feel like 'forced fun.' Bonus if they tie into themes like curiosity, learning, or collaboration.
