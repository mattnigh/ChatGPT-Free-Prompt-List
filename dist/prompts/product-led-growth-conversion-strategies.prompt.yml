I'm designing a product-led growth (PLG) motion. Research how companies like Slack, Loom, Notion, or Dropbox successfully convert free users to paid. Highlight key moments of value, UX conversion triggers, pricing strategies, and any shared metrics or lessons from PMs or founders in interviews or blog posts.
