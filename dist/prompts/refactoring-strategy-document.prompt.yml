I need to create a strategy document for a major codebase refactoring project. Please help me structure this document with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Current State Assessment
3. Problems and Pain Points
4. Proposed Technical Approach
5. Timeline and Milestones
6. Resource Requirements
7. Risk Assessment
8. Success Metrics

For each section, provide a brief description of what should be included and 2-3 guiding questions that will help me complete that section effectively.
