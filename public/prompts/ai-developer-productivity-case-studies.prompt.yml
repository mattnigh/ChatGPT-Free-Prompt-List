Collect 3â€“5 real-world case studies where AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Cody, internal LLMs) were used to improve software development velocity. For each case: include who implemented it, what the AI was used for (e.g., test generation, code suggestions, PR review), measurable outcomes, and links to deeper writeups or talks.
