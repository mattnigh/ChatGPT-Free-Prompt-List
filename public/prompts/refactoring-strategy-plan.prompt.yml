I need to create a strategy document for a major codebase refactoring project. Please help me draft this document with the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the refactoring initiative, goals, and expected outcomes.

2. **Current State Assessment**: Analysis of the existing codebase, architecture, and technology stack.

3. **Problems and Pain Points**: Identification of the issues that necessitate refactoring.

4. **Proposed Technical Approach**: Detailed technical strategy including patterns, technologies, and methodologies.

5. **Timeline and Milestones**: Phased approach with key deliverables and checkpoints.

6. **Resource Requirements**: Team composition, skill requirements, and tooling needs.

7. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies.

8. **Success Metrics**: How we'll measure the success of the refactoring project.

For each section, please provide a brief description of what should be included and 2-3 guiding questions that will help me complete it effectively.
