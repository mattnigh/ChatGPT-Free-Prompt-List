Help me break down this project into a series of 1-2 week sprints. For each sprint, outline: 1) A clear theme/focus, 2) Key deliverables, 3) Major dependencies, and 4) Areas of uncertainty or risk. Focus on a high-level timeline view that helps me understand the overall flow without getting stuck in details. [PASTE: Project description and overall timeline]
