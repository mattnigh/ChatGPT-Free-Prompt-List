Act as a Technical Program Manager writing a program update for VP-level stakeholders. The project is on track, but a key dependency slipped and a decision is pending. Write a weekly status update using this format: Highlights, Risks, Decisions Needed, Next Steps. Keep it tight, transparent, and confidence-inspiring. Provide one version as a Slack message and another as a slide blurb. Source the details from this summary: [PASTE HERE: bullet list of key wins, current blockers, and upcoming milestones].
