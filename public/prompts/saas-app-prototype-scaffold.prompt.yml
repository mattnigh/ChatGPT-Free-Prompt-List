I want to prototype a SaaS app that does [brief description of functionality, e.g., 'helps remote teams track daily standups']. Can you generate a basic project scaffold with a front end (React or Next.js), minimal backend (Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes), and file structure that includes pages for login, dashboard, and settings?
