Summarize how high-performing product orgs (e.g., Notion, Figma, Linear, Canva) structure their product teams. I want detail on PM-to-engineer ratios, the role of product design in decision-making, team rituals (like planning or postmortems), and any internal tooling or documentation habits they've shared publicly.
