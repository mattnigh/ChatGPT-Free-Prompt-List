I'm trying to reduce time-to-first-value (TTFV) in our B2B SaaS onboarding. Research onboarding best practices and patterns used by modern SaaS products. Include UX examples (screenshots or flow descriptions), any known metrics or benchmarks, and tactics that reduce friction (e.g., templates, data import, AI assistants).
