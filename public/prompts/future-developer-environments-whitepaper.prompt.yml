I want to write a white paper on the future of developer environments. Help me explore how Cursor, Codespaces, DevContainers, Copilot Workspace, and other tools are shifting where and how engineers work. Group trends into themes (e.g., local vs. cloud, AI-native vs. terminal-first), and suggest emerging predictions backed by usage data or thought leaders.
